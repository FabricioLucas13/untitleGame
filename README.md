A game project I am currently working on

Trapped inside an old house that seems almost alive, the player must explore every room to find a way to escape before becoming another forgotten victim. The game is a single-player, puzzle-based point and click experience with a strong survival horror atmosphere inspired by Clock Tower: The First Fear, where fear comes not from combat, but from vulnerability, tension, and the constant need to flee.

The house is a claustrophobic labyrinth made up of eleven rooms, two hallways, and several hidden connections through holes in the walls. The objective is simple: solve the necessary puzzles to reassemble a broken key and unlock an exit. Every step forward, however, comes at a cost.

Two major puzzles stand in the player’s way. The first is the pendulum clock in the main hall, which requires finding its missing hands and setting it to the correct current time. The second involves the Three Wise Monkeys: three statuettes scattered throughout the house that must be placed on the fireplace in the library. These puzzles can be completed in any order, but finishing even one of them awakens something that stalks the house.

Once the first puzzle is solved, an antagonist begins to patrol the rooms. This relentless presence hunts the player across the map and punishes hesitation. Hiding may save your life—or seal your fate—depending on whether the enemy is already in the same room. The tension is heightened by the antagonist’s constant whistling, inspired by Latin American folklore such as El Silbón and El Pombero: when the whistle sounds loud and clear, the danger is far away; when it grows faint, the threat is dangerously close.

With no weapons and no way to fight back, the player must learn when to advance, when to run, and when to hide. A single mistake, a door opening, or an unexpected sound can mean death. Only by collecting both pieces of the key and reaching the main entrance or the garage can escape be achieved.

Escape the house to win. Get caught by the antagonist, and it’s over.
